These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.

Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\\nconditions (like in windows).

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism.

possible unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although amoco oil company argues otherwise actual increase valve wear almost unnoticeable however modern leaded gasoline actually contain little lead however check owner manual many car early actually require leaded gasoline q fuel treatment help kind use winter good idea use dry gas however may harmful fuel injection system never use additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol additive may damage fuel system car carbs almost certainly damage car fuel injection manufacturer opinion vary additive containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol car fuel injection check owner manual car using manufacturer consider ethanol acceptable gasoline additive isopropyl alcohol isopropanol petroleum distillate fine fuel injected car occasional bottle fuel injector cleaner helpful car fuel injector although many premium gasoline contain detergent job brand fuel injector cleaner contain ethanol methanol always check ingredient putting anything gas tank small number particularly good additive noticeably expensive run mill one work much much better among chevron techron redline sl wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber bg k bottle one

synthetic get dirty conventional oil synthetic gear lubricant manual transmission another matter entirely amsoil redline agip highly regarded effective mobil synthetic gear lube get mixed review however q manufacturer specifying longer longer oil change interval often change oil depends drive car always nearly always get warmed drive hard keep rev manufacturer recommendation probably fine however drive hard drive high rev alternatively drive supermarket get temperature may wish change oil much often perhaps mile interval given manufacturer specifying mile interval drive car much say mile year probably want change oil every six month anyway storing car winter change oil storing change oil bring storage misc question q car timing belt hear bad thing happen break story depends internal design motor early ford escort example suffer severe valve damage belt break newer car require tow installation new belt honda motor damaged others replacement interval specified car change belt least every mile car may require frequent replacement ask dealer independent mechanic also ask related repair take place time example ford escort suffer valve damage also timing belt driven water pump known seize destroying timing belt cause major valve damage side effect replacing timing belt ignoring water pump costly mistake q would anyone stupid enough design motor self destructs timing belt break performance reason compromising piston design valve piston collide requires compression ratio engine reduced significantly likely avoid valve damage economy car performance oriented vehicle

utrecht netherlands date tue apr gmt line sterrenkundig symposium compacte objecten op april het jaar zeven jaar na de oprichting van de universiteit van utrecht benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld aert jansz de eerste waarnemer en zijn opvolgers voerden de utrechtse sterrenkunde de daaropvolgende jaren decennium en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek dit jaar het jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond de huidige generatie utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde verenigd het sterrekundig instituut utrecht vieren de benoeming van hun oervader middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten zo er voor scholieren een planetenproject programmeert de studium generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de dy natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt er staat echter meer op stapel studenten natuur en sterrenkunde kunnen op april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen de onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige utrechtse onderzoek het onderzoek aan de zogeheten compacte objecten de eindstadia de evolutie van sterren bij de samenstelling van het programma getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia de eerste inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren waarna de zeven overige sprekers lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan na afloop van elke lezing er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel het niveau van de lezingen afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur en sterrenkunde ook andere belangstellenden zijn van harte welkom tijdens de lezing van prof kuijpers zullen al alles goed gaat de veertien radioteleskopen van de radiosterrenwacht westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal westerbork en utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren een zogeheten pulsar de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren prof kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling bespreken en trachten te verklaren het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan de op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak dat pa na een waarnemingsperiode van miljoen jaar genoeg energie opgevangen om een lamp van watt een seconde te laten branden tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden de

        "### Inference on Sentiment Analysis of Blog Posts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Positive: 68.3% of the blog posts express a positive sentiment. This suggests a generally optimistic or favorable tone in the majority of the blogs.\n",
        "2. Negative: 29.6% of the blog posts express a negative sentiment. This indicates a significant presence of critical or unfavorable viewpoints within the blogosphere.\n",
        "3. Neutral: 2.2% of the blog posts are classified as neutral. This implies that most blogs have a clear positive or negative sentiment, with relatively few expressing a neutral stance.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Overall Sentiment: While there is a notable presence of negative sentiment, the overall tone of the blog posts leans towards positivity, with positive sentiment dominating the distribution. This could indicate a generally optimistic or favorable outlook within the blogosphere.\n",
        "\n",
        "Potential Implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Brand perception: For businesses or organizations mentioned in the blogs, the positive sentiment suggests a generally favorable perception. However, it's crucial to address the negative sentiment and understand the concerns or criticisms raised.\n",
        "2. Content strategy: Bloggers and content creators can leverage this information to tailor their content to resonate with the prevailing positive sentiment. Addressing negative feedback and incorporating diverse perspectives can further enhance engagement and credibility.\n",
        "3. Market research: The sentiment analysis provides insights into public opinion and attitudes towards the topics discussed in the blogs. This information can be valuable for market research and understanding consumer preferences."
